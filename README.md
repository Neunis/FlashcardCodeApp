## FlashcardMobileApp

## Lab 2

### App Description
This week we will continue to build our Flashcard app by adding additional features to it. By the end of this lab your Flashcard app should be able to let users create their own flashcard. This will only include displaying the user created card, and the app will not be able to save any data yet. 
Goals:
    -Understand how to handle navigation within an app
    -Understand how to pass data around within the app
