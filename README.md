# FlashcardMobileApp

## Lab 3- Saving Data

### App Description
Flash cards can now be viewed and new ones can now be created, but every time you close the app, all your flash cards are lost! This week we will continue to build onto our Flashcard app and add the ability to save data. By the end of this lab, the Flashcard app should be able save multiple user created cards so that users can revisit the app to review their cards.

#### Goals: Create and view database for flashcards

### App Milestones
The Flashcard app was started by building and focusing on how to add and customize views to be displayed on the screen. The end goals has changed and evolved to having a basic Flashcard app that can display a question, and on tap display the answer to the question, allowing users to create their own flashcard (this includes displaying the user created card though at this time the app will not be able to save any data yet) up until now adding a database to store those questions and answers for future use.

#### Goals: Understand how to handle navigation and pass data around within an app
